# Money

It is not realistic for all alien species to automatically accept the same electronic "credits" as money which humans use. They need a reason to accept this fiat currency.

New aliens use sound money - precious metals - for their own trading. They also are familiar with banks as repositories for metals, and banknotes and electronic transactions. However, it is all backed by precious metals. They are skeptical of "credits" which are backed by nothing.

Initially they pay you in physical precious metals, which you take to a human world to sell. The final stage in all paid jobs is to land on a human world to "exchange your precious metals for credits", at which point you are paid.

This is not sustainable as it would result in draining local stores of precious metals through a trade imbalance. Same problem Europe had with China in the 19th century - Europeans were paying in silver to buy tea and china from China, but little silver was returning, so China was becoming richer. The solution there was opium - England pushed opium into China, which was paid for in silver, returning silver to England. This was very unpopular with the Chines government, and resulted in the opium wars, where England won and subdued China.

Two-way trade is required. And all other civilisations use "credits" for this trade. So they must learn about credits and open local accounts to receive them - at least for international exchange, no need to use them domestically.

Solution:

- Take delegation to human space to start financial relationship, while retaining secrecy. This MAY involve exchange of ambassadors, or be on an interbank level only.
- Open "trading" a few weeks / months after returning delegation.
- Open spaceport and outfitters once products available to sell (depends upon other jobs).

# Secrecy

New aliens do not wish to advertise their presence to all space. 

- Few delegations to human space. None elsewhere.
- These few delegates & traders disguise themselves using wheelchairs.
- Human ships used for intergalactic commerce? Makes sense as saves them developing own ships too fast.

# Human ships

Medium term: Could start a secret relationship with one specific trusted human shipyard, and resell that shipyards ships and outfits in the outfitter alongside developing alien technology. Would give aliens a ready source of ships.
