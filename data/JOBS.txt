					`	As you enter the bar, you see your friend Tokani sitting at the back, drinking that awful drink... Ugh! It makes your stomach lurch even to think about it! you order a small bite to eat then go and sit next to Tokani. you start talking together for a bit,until Tokani finishes his mug. he looks at you, then quietly whispers to you, "Wait a moment and then follow me out." He then hops to the front of the room, hands in his mug, and walks out the door. this all seems very suspicious but you do as Tokani said. when you walk out the door you see him standing a we bit away, he becans to you. You follow him to a building on the outskirts of the town. It has guards posted in all the doorways. and you enter it through a hidden back door. you are soon following Tokani through a labrenth of hallways, going somwhere you do not know.`

					choice
							`	"Uhh... okay?"`
					label talk
					`	Soon you enter a large room with a table in the middle. there are half a dozen monopods seated around it. "Here's the space alien." Tokani says to the other monopods. Most of them look in amusement and interest at your two legs... something you've gotten used to by now. You are shown to a seat, you sit down. one of the monopods starts to speak. `
					`	"Space Alien. we have heard of your landing on our planet and are very exited to learn about all this new technolegy you have brought us. would you be willing to help us advance and be able to do much more things then we are able to do now?`

					`	"Thank you Alien!" A second monopod says. "We would especialy like to take a look around your space plane to learn about all the different technolegy you have." He tells you. "could we come and see you and your space plane tomorrow?"`
					choice
							`	"Okay!"`
								goto nextday

					`	"Of course Alien!" A second monopod says. "What would you like to know?"

								goto learnwhat
					label whoyou
					`	"We are the rulers of this planet, and since you landing on this planet is a very big event, we have all got together to talk with you. does that answer your question?"`
					choice
							`	"Yes."`
								goto next
					label secretmeet
					`	"Why not?" all the monopods say together. they obviously are not going to answer your question.

					`	The next day, you are outside your ship, wipeing the dew off it, when some cloacked figures hop up to you.`
					`	"Could we come inside you're space plane?" they ask. you have no idea who they are. should you let them in, or should you not?`
					choice
							`	"Yes you can come in."`
							`	"I have no idea who you are, why should I let you in?"`

					choice
							`	"Welcome inside!"`
							`	"why did you come in disguise?"`
								goto disguise
					`	"Thank you." they say as they start looking around your 'space plane'. They are amazed at all the different parts of the ship, especialy the sheilds.`
					`	"What are these for?" they ask you.`
					`	"These are sheilds, and they absorb the impact from other ship's guns which are trying to shoot you."`
					`	"Why would other space planes be trying to shoot you?"`
					`	"They might be pirates trying to steal your stuff, or they might be the enamy if you are in the middle of a war."`
					`	"Ahh!" They say, and keep looking round your ship.`
					`	They are also very interested in the life support systems and the engines. After a while of them looking and you explaining things, they done their clocks and hop out the door.`
					`	Just as they are leaving, one of them whispers in your ear,`
					`	"Tokani will come to take you to another meeting shortly. Be ready to come imediatly." he then quickly Jumps out the door.`
