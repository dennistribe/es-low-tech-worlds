# Premise of missions:
# Wormhole is unstable and unreliable. The player needs to find a quantum keystone to stabilise the wormhole (with which the player will be able to travel through it at all times)
# Future: Need to disable the dialogs below if the player has a quantum keystone.

# On first discovery of wormhole, wormhole is open
# Quietly lock wormhole when first land on monopod planet
# When visit the system with the wormhole in it, alert player that the wormhole is now closed.
