			`During your short flight, Huasi says very little. She is clearly very nervous around you, and not confident with your language. She also appears grief-stricken.`
			`	You land on a flat, grass airstrip clearly designed only for small aeroplanes. Your spaceship barely fits. You are greeted by a group of monopods, some armed and in the military uniforms of the central government, and some unarmed in civilian clothing. Huasi points to one monopod who is standing tall in the centre with a grim expression on his face. "Paru King" she says.`
			`	Huasi says something to the king, and is yelled at by one of the armed guards. She turns to you with a tear in her eye, and says "Told not call Paru King. Just Paru."`
			choice
				`	"I must meet with King Paru alone, without the soldiers."`
			`Huasi nervously translates your message to the soldiers, and they are visibly angry. However, they are under orders to allow you to meet with the Yuhavi leadership, and after a brief discussion allow Huasi and yourself to enter a meeting room in the palace with the former king and his aides. Some stand guard outside the door, while others stand outside the windows watching you.`
			`	King Paru's aides close the curtains, and you all sit down at the corner of the room furtherest from the door and windows. King Paru speaks quietly to Huasi, who translates to you.`
			`	"King Paru angry you give weapons to self-appointed 'global government'. Why you help them?"`
			choice
				`	"I did not know they were at war. I did not know you existed."`
				`	"They were worried that if I had found them, other 'aliens' might also. I brought them weapons for self-defence against space pirates."`
			`Huasi translates, and the king discusses this with his aides. Huasi finally responds "King says you not enemy."`
			`	The king next says, through Huasi, "Government want send us Uca Cevata. We no want this. We live here. You help us get land back?"`
			choice
				`	"No, I do not want to choose sides in your war."`
				`	"No, you are terrorists who have killed thousands of innocent people. I will not help you."`

			`	"New government army come in, we fight back. But army too big, we too small. Too few people. Hard.`
			`	"Smart scientist say, fight with robot. Save people. Make driving robot, flying robot, swimming robot. Boom!`
			`	"When army come in, boom. Nobody know where boom next, surprise. So army not come in. Peace."`
			choice
				`	"Why did you target civilians?"`
			`"Mostly lie. We target army. But some mistake, some bad decision. Angry robot driver do bad thing, punished. Civilians die both sides. War evil."`
			choice
				`	"How were you defeated?"`
			`"Weapons you give shoot robot. Stop boom. End peace. Army not scared, come in. Too many. Fight brave, but..." the king is crying quietly now and has stopped talking.`
			`	The king motions for one of his aides to continue.`
			`	"Paru King old. Not go Uca Cevata. Take long time, not finish before king die." The aide then talks to the king before making his next statement. "People not happy king. Lose war. Lose respect. People happy king son Pagu." The aide points to the young monopod beside the king. "Pagu lead people Uca Cevata."`
			`	Pagu now speaks. "Lose land bad. But gain Uca Cevata good. We have whole planet. Bad planet, but all ours. Hard work, but Yuhavi strong. Become great space people."`
			`	"Cannot do without you help. You take me Uca Cevata?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I will show you the planet."`

			`You fly around the planet carefully several times, while one of the monopods with Pagu carefully scans the surface with a camera-like device. Huasi explains they are creating a detailed map of the planet and scanning for near-surface minerals. `
			`	After considering the map, Pagu selects several landing sites. At each site, Pagu and his aides leave the ship and hop slowly around (they get out of breath quickly in the thin atmosphere), looking at the landscape and thinking. One takes core samples of the soil.`
			`	Finally Pagu indicates his visit is complete, and you prepare to return to Imatai.`

			choice
				`The Yuhavi cannot pay me for helping them visit Uca Cevata, as you have taken their treasury. Will you pay?`
			`"We have fairly taken their treasury as partial compensation for our damages suffered in the war. We will pay you for any work that we have asked you to do. We will not pay you for anything they have requested, unless we agree to it beforehand. We did not ask you to take a delegation to Uca Cevata yet, so will not pay you for that."`
			`	"But we do have a job for you we will pay you for. The Yuhavi will need people-carrying spaceships to transport them to Uca Cevata. Our engineers have spent the last two weeks building a suitable spaceship, and we would like you to help test it."`
			choice
				` "What sort of a spaceship can you build in two weeks?"`
			`"We have high altitude aeroplanes that are already pressurised. We have taken an obsolete aeroplane, sealed it better for operation in a full vacuum, and installed the engines we built for the Katani. With these engines it should only take a day to travel to Uca cevata, so the travellers need only seats, not bunks."`
			`	They take you to a hanger, where you see the scariest looking "spaceship" you have ever seen. It is simply a large aeroplane with the wings chopped off past the engines, and a patchwork of plates welded on to strategic parts that must have needed strengthening.`
			`	You enter the plane, and find that every emergency exit has been welded shut, leaving only one door, which has been replaced with a heavier duty sealed door. There is no airlock - the one door opens directly into the main cabin.`
			choice
				`	"Why have the emergency exits been welded shut?"`
				`	"What makes you think this is safe?"`
			`"The weakest points where there could be leaks are the doors. Every door has been welded shut to eliminate the risk of leaks. There is now only one door, which is a spaceship door that another spaceship can dock with. It should be as safe as the Katani.`
			`	"But this one has remote control for the first test flight. Just in case. The engineers think it is safe, but none of our pilots are willing to fly it.`

You request a confidential meeting with a senior management official about a business opportunity, and after considerable debate with the receptionist (who thinks you are just another travelling salesperson), you are finally given a 5 minute appointment with a member of the shipyard upper management committee.`

I would like to give you the opportunity first because of your good reputation. This meeting and any commercial arrangements would however need to be made in complete secrecy."`

			`	"Then how can I know you are telling the truth?" says the official.`
			`	"How can I know I can trust you with any of the information I am giving you?" you respond.`
			`	He considers that for a moment, and then says "I suppose you have to trust me, and I have to trust you, to some degree. But I do need to see some evidence this is a real proposal, and not a practical joke being pulled by my junior staff. It's my birthday you see, so it's just the day they'd choose to do something crazy like that."`

			`	"In brief, these aliens wish to provide manufacturing facilities in return for ships and finances."`
			`	"Why would aliens want human spaceships?"`
			`	"Let's discuss that later. Might this sort of arrangement fit in with your shipyard?"`
			`	The official ponders that question for a minute, before replying "Yes, actually, it would. We are highly dependent upon the Syndicate to manufacture many components of our ships. Having another component manufacturer could be beneficial. However, I suspect that our major outfit supplier Kraz Cybernetics may be also interested in such a relationship, and as the businesses of Southbound and Kraz are heavily interdependent, it would be best to discuss any such arrangements with Kraz also.`

			`	You exit the ship, and are assured this building is completely secure and private. You tell the Yuhasi that it is safe for them to leave the ship also. They hop out of the airlock door, clearly pleased to no longer be cooped up in the ship.`

				`	Explain the situation`
			`	You first explain that the Yuhavi have never had contact with humans or any other species before, and have not yet developed space flight. They are very concerned about secrecy, and wish to keep the location of their system a closely guarded secret, at least until they have the military strength to resist pirates. You then explain their forced migration to an icy world, and their need for both spaceships for the colonisation, and their need to build a profitable economy on that world.`
			`	The Yuhavi show some samples of the electronic equipment they produce for their own use, and the Kraz and Southbound engineers are impressed with the quality of their workmanship and innovative approaches. The Kraz delegation show the Yuhavi samples of equipmentt they currently source from the Syndicate, and the Yuhavi indicate that they could manufacture these.`
			choice
				`	Negotiate a commercial agreement`
			`Negotiations are difficult because the Yahavi have so little to offer today, they can only promise what they will do in the future.`
			`	Finally, a tentative agreement is reached. Southbound will loan the Yuhavi ships, and train their pilots. Kraz will help establish factories producing specific components required by both companies.`
			`	The Yuhavi in return agree that they will only supply Southbound and Kraz, no other shipyards, and all technical innovations they may develop over the next 50 years (such as novel outfits or ships) will be licenced to Kraz or Southbound and sold exclusively through them.`
			`	The Yuhavi have always been proudly independent, and it is very difficult for Pagu to agree to such a long-term partnership. But Southbound and Kraz will be investing a lot into this arrangement, and need long-term security for their investments. `
			`	Southbound and Kraz will sign the contract once their representatives have visited Uca Cevata and Imatai to verify the situation themselves. The Southbound engineer Sheree, and the Kraz architect Daniel volunteer to travel with you.`

# Atmosphere limitations - thin, low CO2, limit to plant growth possible so cannot solve O2 just by growing plants. Slow O2 replenishment by algaes etc, already depleting with monopod breathing.
# Early steps: 
# - O2 generation by electrolysis, use in buildings.
# - Greenhouse food production - coal imported to boost CO2 in greenhouses & heat.
# Once terraforming university established - student to university
# Eventual plan:
# - Blacken surface with coal dust / soot, reduce reflection & boost heat.
# - Orbital mirrors focus on specific spots, boil ice -> water vapour, greenhouse effect & clouds. Also clearing areas of ice for agriculture.
# - Raise O2 with massively upscaled electrolysis of ice. Export H2 as product.
# - Raise CO2 with coal burned with this O2
# - Introduce cold-tolerant mountain-dwelling plants, grown from this CO2, to boost natural oxygen cycle.
# - Always thin atmosphere unless import masses of nitrogen, but can have high O2 so easily breathable despite thinness.
