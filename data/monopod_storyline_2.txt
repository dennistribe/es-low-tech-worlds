		`During your short flight, Huasi says very little. She is clearly very nervous around you, and not confident with your language. She also appears grief-stricken, presumably at the entire sitaution.`
		`	You land on a flat, grass airstrip clearly designed only for small aeroplanes. Your spaceship barely fits. You are greeted by a group of monopods, some armed and in the military uniforms of the central government, and some unarmed in civilian clothing. Huasi points to one monopod who is standing tall in the centre with a grim expression on his face. "Paru King" she says.`
		`	Huasi says something to the king, and is yelled at by one of the armed guards. She turns to you with a tear in her eye, and says "Told not call Paru King. Just Paru."`

However, they are under orders to allow you to meet with the Yuhavi leadership, and after a brief discussion allow Huasi and yourself to enter a meeting room in the palace with the former king and his aides. Some stand guard outside the door, while others stand outside the windows watching you.`
		`	King Paru's aides close the curtains, and you all sit down at the corner of the room furtherest from the door and windows. King Paru speaks quietly to Huasi, who translates to you.`

			`	"I did not know they were at war. I did not know you existed."`
			`	"They were worried that if I had found them, other 'aliens' might also. I brought them weapons for self-defence against space pirates."`

		`	The king next says, through Huasi, "Government want send us Uca Cevata. We no want this. We live here. You help us get land back?"`

		`"Weapons you give shoot robot. Stop boom. End peace. Army not scared, come in. Too many. Fight brave, but..." the king is crying quietly now and has stopped talking.`
		`	The king motions for one of his aides to continue.`
		`	"Paru King old. Not go Uca Cevata. Take long time, not finish before king die." The aide then talks to the king before making his next statement. "People not happy king. Lose war. Lose respect. People happy king son Pagu." The aide points to the young monopod beside the king. "Pagu lead people Uca Cevata."`
		`	Pagu now speaks. "Lose land bad. But gain Uca Cevata good. We have whole planet. Bad planet, but all ours. Hard work, but Yuhavi strong. Become great space people."`

			`	After considering the map, Pagu selects several landing sites. At each site, Pagu and his aides leave the ship and hop slowly around (they get out of breath quickly in the thin atmosphere), looking at the landscape and thinking. One takes core samples of the soil.`

				`The Yuhavi cannot pay me for helping them visit Uca Cevata, as you have taken their treasury. Will you pay?`
			`"We have fairly taken their treasury as partial compensation for our damages suffered in the war. We will pay you for any work that we have asked you to do. We will not pay you for anything they have requested, unless we agree to it beforehand. We did not ask you to take a delegation to Uca Cevata yet, so will not pay you for that."`

We have taken an obsolete aeroplane, sealed it better for operation in a full vacuum, and installed the engines we built for the Katani. With these engines it should only take a day to travel to Uca cevata, so the travellers need only seats, not bunks."`

However, I suspect that our major outfit supplier Kraz Cybernetics may be also interested in such a relationship, and as the businesses of Southbound and Kraz are heavily interdependent, it would be best to discuss any such arrangements with Kraz also.`

			`When you land on Uca cevata, the settlement site is a hive of activity. There are piles of building materials and other equipment, small forklifts moving around busily, and many monopods beginning construction of a structure of some sort. The space-plane and one star barge are parked and being unloaded, the other spaceships are presumably in transit to or from Imatai.`
			`	Pagu is soon notified of your arrival, and comes to meet you with Huasi. He is clearly frustrated to see the government delegation get out of the <ship>.`
			`	Although you cannot understand the entire conversation, you can tell that Pagu greets the government delegation coldly and formally. They angrily ask him many rapid questions, which he answers calmly. They are obviously very worried about 'aliens', and are slightly relieved to hear that there are no aliens here other than yourself - the spaceships are piloted by Yuhavi.` 
			`	They ask Pagu many questions about where the spaceships came from and what agreement he has made with the 'aliens' who provided them. He gives short answers that clearly do not satisfy them.`
			`	Eventually Pagu states deliberately (and Huasi translates for your benefit) "Thankyou for your time, but I am very busy. I have to get back to work now." Then he turns around and hops away without waiting for a response.`
			`	The government delegation get back in your ship and tell you to return them to Imatai.`
